## v1.0.1 - Streamline Microsoft Planner automation
Microsoft Planner helper centralizes bucket/user resolution, assignment building, task detail updates, and category syncing so Instago flows can create Planner tasks via Graph with fewer moving pieces.

### Added
- Added configuration defaults plus bucket/bucket-name resolution, assignment building, label/category syncing, and reference merging to simplify Planner task creation and detail updates.
- Added `assignTask` along with robust priority/date parsing and bucket/user resolvers so Planner work stays synced even when inputs are partial.
